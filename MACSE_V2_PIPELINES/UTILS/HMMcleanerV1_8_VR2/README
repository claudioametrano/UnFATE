-del-charchan
 This library need an installation of HMMER 3.0 (March 2010); 
 Avalaible on http://hmmer.org/
 For compatible UNIX distributions :   < sudo apt-get install hmmer >

 USAGE :
  ./HMMcleanAA.pl [--no-hmm] [--change-id] [--del-char c] [--define-cost c1 c2 c3 c4] <amino acid fasta file> <threshold>

 <threshold> 10 is a value good value to test. A low threshold will lead to more deleted segment.



 OUTPUT :
  On the standard output, for each sequence of the fasta file given as input :
    <fasta file path>	<sequence identifier>	<number of position deleted>
   The fasta file created for the new alignment with
    - spaces (-) standing for old gap positions
    - white spaces standing for newly deleted position
   The html file to visualise the results (disabled in the current version)
   The log file with the list of deleted regions
   The score file to see the HMMER result

 OPTION :

    --no-hmm 
	If you want to try without installing HMMER.
		-- At your own risk --

    --change-id
	Will add a specific pattern to the species names.

    --del-char c
	Will use the user define character to mask the deleted positions

    --define-cost c1 c2 c3 c4
	Define the 4 cost for Hmmer output constraint on cost are c1 <= c2 <= 0 <= c3 <= c4
	Default is -3 -1 threshold/5 threshold/2


 TEST :
  ./HMMcleanAA.pl Ten_Fasta_For_Testing/GNTPAN12210.ali 10
